# Introduction
I obtained a double master's degree in [Security and Cloud Computing](https://www.secclo.eu/) from [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi/en/) in Finland and [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/) in France in 2022.
My master's thesis was about the Internet-of-Things Security. The thesis was completed under the co-supervision of professor [Janne Lindqvist](https://www.aalto.fi/sv/personer/janne-lindqvist) from Aalto and professor [Aur√©lien Francillon](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~aurel/) from EURECOM.

During my study, I spent a year with the cybersecurity research team at Nokia Bells Lab in Finland and a few months during the summer in the [S3 research group](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/)

Prior to that, I had a few years of experience as a mobile engineer in Vietnam, where I maintained the [Samsung Notes app](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-notes) and released its apk for Galaxy series M.

I am a Vietnamese citizen who got a bachelor degree in Information Technology from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) 

Besides Engish, I understand basic French, Finnish, and Korean.
